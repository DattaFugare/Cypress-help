///////////////////////////////

cy.visit() failed trying to load:

https://www.amazon.in/

We attempted to make an http request to this URL but the request failed without a response.

We received this error at the network level:

> Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND www.amazon.in

Common situations why this would fail:
- you don't have internet access
- you forgot to run / boot your web server
- your web server isn't accessible
- you have weird network configuration settings on your computer

ans--> internet off

///////////////////////////////////////////////
This element <input#add-to-cart-button.a-button-input.attach-dss-atc> is not visible because its parent <div#bbAppliedState.a-section.a-spacing-none.hide> has CSS property: display: none

Fix this problem, or use {force: true} to disable error checking

CypressError
Timed out retrying after 10050ms: cy.click() failed because this element:

<input type="radio" name="lop" value="hi_IN">

is being covered by another element:

<i class="a-icon a-icon-radio"></i>

Fix this problem, or use {force: true} to disable error checking.

CypressError
Timed out retrying after 10000ms: cy.find() failed because the page updated as a result of this command, but you tried to continue the command chain. The subject is no longer attached to the DOM, and Cypress cannot requery the page after commands such as cy.find().

Common situations why this happens:
- Your JS framework re-rendered asynchronously
- Your app code reacted to an event firing and removed the element

You can typically solve this by breaking up a chain. For example, rewrite:

> cy.get('button').click().should('have.class', 'active')

to

> cy.get('button').as('btn').click()
> cy.get('@btn').should('have.class', 'active')
